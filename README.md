## Computer Science / IMGD Major, Cartograbird Gameplay & Story Programmer

# Project Description
Cartograbird is an open world exploration game in which the player is tasked to find the scattered parts of a crash landed explorer. The game has flight mechanics for the main character Carmen to soar around the world in search of these parts. The player can look at their map to orient themselves and document their exploration. Cartograbird was developed using Unreal Engine 4.

# My Contribution
The main focus of my work on Cartograbird was to program the main gameplay mechanic of flight, as well as program the game's story. I implemented character and camera movement, as well as a dialogue and quest progression system. To achieve these objectives, I used both C++ and Unreal Engine 4's Blueprints scripting language.
